# DevOps Monitoring Challenge
------

Congratulations on making it to the Monitoring Challenge! Companies today are working on building monitoring
solutions to have better insight on the health and performance of their computing systems. Your challenge
today is to set up a monitoring stack to capture data points from two live EC2 instances! ​ 

**All tools and AWS services are** ​ **FREE!**
**Submission equals invitation to interview!** ​ ​ **Incomplete solutions are welcomed!**

**Submit a single PDF containing an image of your dashboard in action and any additional notes.** 
We will ask for the live dashboard during the interview!
